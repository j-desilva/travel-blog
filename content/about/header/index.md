I'm a 20-something Australian from Sydney who loves to explore the world 
and seek out new and challenging experiences. 
For me, it's not about the quantity of places I have been, but about the quality 
time spent at each one. "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people
just exist" - Oscar Wilde.
