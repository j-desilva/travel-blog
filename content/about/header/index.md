<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a 26y.o. Aussie girl from Sydney, exploring the world 
to seek out new and challenging experiences. 
For me, it's not about the quantity of places I have been, but about the quality 
of time spent at each one. "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people
just exist" - Oscar Wilde.
