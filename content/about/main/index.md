  2024 has just begun and I'm excited to have a few adventures lined up for 
  the upcoming months. A few camping trips testing out new gear, and an overseas
  trip - my first time visiting the United Kingdom. If you have any good tips
  or recommendations, reach out via the contact form and connect with me!
