  Living a rich life is about experiences, not stuff. I get true value
  out of being outside, exploring, seeing places that feel like you're in
  a dream, and partaking in activities that lead me out of my comfort zone.
  If you have any good tips or recommendations, please reach out via the 
  contact form and connect with me!
