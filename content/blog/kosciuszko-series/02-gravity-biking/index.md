## Intro
So what the heck is gravity biking? I didn't know either until researching 
things to do at Thredbo during the summer. Gravity riding is a form of mountain 
biking that focuses on downhill speed and stunts, although in my case, this
statement was true only for the 'downhill' part. Put very simply, you take a lift 
up the mountain with your bike, and ride back down on various trails. 
Thredbo is home to Australia's Only Lift-Accessed MTB Park. 
And let me tell you... it is addictive once you get started. 

[Mountain Bike Beginner Guide](https://www.thredbo.com.au/activities/biking/mtb-beginner-guide/).

The Mountain Bike park is open from mid November - end of April. Then winter hits and Thredbo transforms into some of the best ski fields that 
Australia has to offer... what a place!

## Getting there

If you are staying outside of the Thredbo area of the Kosciuszko National
Park, you will need a permit to enter this section (even if just passing through). 
This is very easy to do on the day. Simply pay for a vehicle pass (roughly $17)
when entering the park via the entry station on Alpine Way. You also have the 
option to pay in advance for an [annual pass](https://pass.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/pass/selection) 
that will cover access to all NSW National Parks.

Finding parking is extremely easy in the summer (unlike winter). There are plenty of
day parking areas (7am-7pm) visibly marked out once you get onto Friday Drive 
(the main road that links to all of the chairlifts). Parking fees are 
included with your vehicle pass. 

There are also overnight parking areas if you plan to stay past 7pm - like 
when I did the [Full Moon Kosciuszko Summit Tour](https://lighthearted-pegasus-d643a3.netlify.app/blog/kosciuszko-series/05-kosciuszko-summit/#summit-by-night).

Once youâ€™ve arrived in Thredbo, your first step is to pick up your 
[MyThredbo card](https://www.thredbo.com.au/mythredbo/), 
known as your personal key to Thredbo. There are 24-7 MyThredbo Card Kiosks 
located near the base of the chairlifts. Whenever you buy a lift pass or lesson,
it will be loaded onto this card.

## MTB Lift Pass

There are 2 options when buying a [MTB lift pass](https://shop.thredbo.com.au/s/summer-passes-2/lift-passes-4/). You can get
a MTB Adventure Pass (Includes lift access + added activities: $99-$119), or just the MTB Lift Pass on its own ($89-$109).

Both passes give you access to 3 alpine lifts (and a gondola) fitted with bike 
racks for endless amounts of fun on over 40km of mountain bike trails.

If you get the MTB Adventure Pass, you get access to the bobsled (among other
things)... which in my opinion, is something not to miss out on, purely 
because of the nostalgic feeling of being a kid again :) For the extra $10,
definitely worth it.

It's important to [keep updated](https://www.thredbo.com.au/weather/lifts-trails/) 
on the weather, as well as lift and trail closures so you know what to expect 
when you arrive. Gunbarrel Chairlift was closed when I was here, so the only
way to get to the easier trails was to take Merritts Gondola, followed by
Cruiser Chairlift.

## Bike & Gear Hire

Bikes and gear conveniently located at [Thredbo Retail & Rental.](https://www.thredbo.com.au/activities/biking/retail-rental/)

## The Experience

Going up the chairlift for the very first time is so exhilarating. Feelings of
nervousness and excitement are flooding through. This is something I have never
experienced before, and that's what it's all about.
What is it going to be like? Can I acutally do this? The answer is yes you can.
And although the first lap down was very slow and I actually got off and walked
my bike around many of the corners... by the thrird time down, WATCH OUT IM
COMING FOR YOU!! It was so incredibly fun. I spent my first few laps going down
Upper Easy Rider and Lower Easy Rider until I felt more confident. It didn't 
take too long.

Then it was on to Sidewinder to bring me all the way back down the mountain.
