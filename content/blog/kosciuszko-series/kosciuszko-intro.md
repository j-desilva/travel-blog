For this trip, I spent most of my time in the Thredbo-Perisher area (area 1), and did a day trip out to Yarrangobilly (area 5) on the second day. Home base for the duration of this break was Jindabyne (more info on camping below).

### Thredbo-Perisher Area

There are tonnes of things to do in this area.

### Yarrangobilly Area

On this day trip, I went to the Yarrangobilly caves and thermal pool (which you can see in [this post](https://lighthearted-pegasus-d643a3.netlify.app/blog/kosciuszko-series/03-caves-thermal/)).

## Camping

I ended up camping at the NRMA Holiday Park in Jindabyne.
